This project is aimed at furthering the understanding of maternal deaths in the United States of America through the analysis of data and visualisations created in Python.

Maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrelevant of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggregated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes (World Health Organization, 2019). This is the definition that we have chosen to use in our research, although there are variations in this time period across scholarship.

The Maternal Mortality Rate is simply the number of deaths related to a female’s pregnancy within a population in a given time period. The Maternal Mortality Ratio in contrast, is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) — MEASURE Evaluation, 2020). The Maternal Mortality Ratio can be calculated by dividing the recorded number of maternal deaths by the total recorded or estimated number of live births in the same period in a given population and then multiplying it by 100,000 (unstats | Millennium Indicators, 2020). We have used the abbreviation "MMR" for Maternal Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Ratio throughout the project, however before using it in a paragraph we have always determined whether it refers to Rate or Ratio in the next couple of sentences. 

We have investigated the research question: “Is there a significant relationship between the social factors of age, education and race/ethnicity

that influence maternal mortality rates in the U.S., and is there a visible correlational relationship between victims’ access to hospitals  and their deaths?”. There is no doubt that this is a densely complicated interconnected issue, but we aim to investigate this by approaching what we believe to be key factors that can indicate who is most affected and why.  

According to Nina Martin “the ability to protect the health of mothers and babies in childbirth is a basic measure of a society's development” (Martin, 2017), however the US are experiencing a Maternal Health Care crisis, which leads to rising Maternal Mortality Rates (DEADLY DELIVERY: THE MATERNAL HEALTH CARE CRISIS IN THE USA, 2011). According to NPR, the US has “the worst rate of maternal deaths in the developed world” (Martin, 2017). This will be emphasised more in the visualisations, showing the changes of Maternal Mortality Rates of different countries (Read more).

We split the project into different parts; we looked at the worldwide Maternal Mortality Rates, visualising the fact that the US has a rising Maternal Mortality Rate, in comparison to other countries. To better understand geographic disparities, we have visualised state by state variation in the Maternal Mortality Ratio. 

Moreover, we sought to investigate social disparities within the states, choosing factors such as age, race and education and their correlation to Maternal Mortality Rates, by carrying out Chi-Squared tests. This helps identify who is worst affected. 

We then looked at the five states of the US with the highest (worst) and lowest (best) Maternal Mortality Rates in 2019 and visualised the correlation between MMR and the number of hospitals per state, in order to examine potential causes of maternal deaths. This element could serve to indicate structures and services that might be causing this. 

This website is structured into an introductory part including Literature Review and Aims, Methodology and Data Sources, Analysis and Visualisations and a written Conclusion where we discuss our Analysis and consider some policy suggestions.
